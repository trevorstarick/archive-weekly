# Spotify Discover Weekly Archiver
Archives SPOTIFY'S Discover Weekly playlist for later listening.  (Something that Spotify should have implemented IMHO)

TODO:
- [ ] Better comments
- [ ] Optimize how Request is making get and post requests with headers. It
- [ ] feels like it could be declared somewhere at the top of the file instead
- [ ] of every time a request is made.
- [ ] Callback city like usual...
- [ ] Set up some type of CRON to run every Wednesday so that Spotify has enough
- [ ] time to create and push the playlists to everyone.
- [ ] Set up a landing page via GH-Pages
